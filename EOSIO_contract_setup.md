## TESTNET
Follow these steps: 
* Join the testnet - http://jungle.cryptolions.io/#home
* Create account - http://jungle.cryptolions.io/#account
* Create the keys from `cleos` on the bash-cmd using 
  `cleos create key --to-console` (saving keys onto a file is not required for testnet)
* All the keys are saved in a file into a local directory.
* Also, `alias cleos='cleos -u http://dev.cryptolions.io:38888/' <br/>
  Now, you can use cleos and easy going while adding other commands 
  
  NOTE: valid for that session only. When closed, it will have to be recreated.
