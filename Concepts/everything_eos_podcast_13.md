## Salient Points - 
### EOS Resources - 
Computational (CPU), Bandwidth (NET), RAM (Storage) 
### RAM discussion - 
* storage on the network
* speculators bought all of them
* it peaked 0.92 EOS/KB of RAM
* account creation - 4KB of RAM
* Airdrops free on genesis snapshot for already registered a/c
* 15k USD for launching airdrops.
* 15 USD for one account.
* In future, EOS account will be universal one.
* Solutions - the ability to profit/loss out of staking should be eliminated.
* EOS price is being hurt due to RAM price. Bcoz one has to buy EOS tokens to buy ram.
* @dan solution - taxation on the profit from RAM
* To increase the ram supply - sidechains.
* sidechain - branch of tree,  mainnet- main trunk of tree.
* airdrops on mainchain, but running on sidechain. BPs to process both mainchain and sidechain txns.
* Due to txn fee for RAM, inflation is -2 (negative). And the extra tokens getting burnt. This is how the inflation is negative.
