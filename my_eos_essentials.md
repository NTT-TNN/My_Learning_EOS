# My EOS Essentials
## FAQs
1. ### What if BPs pay people to vote for them?
    In EOS, the no. of votes getting count also depends on new/old votes. This is done every 6 months. That is after this period it becomes old.
    So, now the BPs shall have to raise the awareness everytime to EOS users for staying in the top 21 BPs and 100 SPs.

2. ### What else the BPs and SPs can do other than just recording the Blockchain data?
    They can volunteerly educate the people about EOS or decentralisation. This will make them more competent in the EOS producer candidate list.

3. ### Will the EOS BPs number be 21 for lifetime? Can't we configure in the future if required?
    Yes, it can be done.

    The default number is 21, however in the latest (in Jan 2018) development update, they confirmed it would be dynamic/configurable.ï»¿

4. ### Is EOS Smart Contract (SC) upgradeable?
    Yes. Unlike Ethereum, EOS contracts are upgradeable.

    Hence, **Code is NOT the law.**

5. ### Can EOS transaction be reversible like other major blockchains?
    Yes. 

    But, it is possible through arbitration. In future, for dApps' good functioning, one has to hire **competent arbitrators** for getting any form of transaction (money, asset, so on...) back. 

6. ### EOS key terms?
    **Block** - group of transactions.
    **Transaction** - record of actions.
    **Action** - behavior of contracts.
