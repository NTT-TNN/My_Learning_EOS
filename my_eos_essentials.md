## FAQs
#### What if BPs pay people to vote for them?
In EOS, the no. of votes getting count also depends on new/old votes. This is done every 6 months. That is after this period it becomes old.
So, now the BPs shall have to raise the awareness everytime to EOS users for staying in the top 21 BPs and 100 SPs.

#### What else the BPs and SPs can do other than just recording the Blockchain data?
They can volunteerly educate the people about EOS or decentralisation. This will make them more competent in the EOS producer candidate list.
